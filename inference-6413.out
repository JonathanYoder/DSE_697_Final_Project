[{'generated_text': 'How is wheat grown?  {\nWheat is a cereal crop that is widely grown for food and animal feed. It is a hardy and drought-tolerant crop that can thrive in a variety of soil types and climates. Wheat is typically sown in rows or drilled, with the seeds placed at a depth of 2-5 cm and spaced 10-20 cm apart. The crop requires regular irrigation during periods of drought, and it is typically harvested when the stalks have turned from green to yellow or brown. Wheat is a high-yielding crop, with typical yields ranging from 2-6 tons per hectare, depending on the variety and growing conditions. It is a staple crop in many regions and is an important source of food and feed for millions of people around the world.  {\nWhat is the ideal planting depth for wheat?  {\nThe ideal planting depth for wheat varies depending on the variety and growing conditions, but it is typically sown at a depth of 2-5 cm.
