Keyser UT Center for Native Grasslands Management Fred L. Allen UT Department of Plant Sciences Sammy S. Sadaka and Mahmoud A. Sharara University of Arkansas Department of Biological and Agricultural Engineering\nBiochar, a charcoal-like substance, is the byproduct of heating any organic material (such as switchgrass) at relatively low temperatures and with limited oxygen. This process is known as pyrolysis and is used for biofuel conversion. Pyrolysis produces heat, gases, a substance similar to crude oil (i.e. bio-oil), and biochar (Figure 1). If cellulosic bioenergy production reaches the scale that has been projected, millions of tons of biochar will be produced annually as a byproduct. One possible use of this byproduct is to apply it back onto switchgrass or other agricultural fields as a soil amendment. Such applications may improve soil carbon content and enhance nutrient additions. This could lead to a closed-loop system, considering the biochar is re-applied to switchgrass fields the following season. Yield responses from biochar applications have been mixed, from negative, no response, to positive. Positive responses may more likely occur from applications on sandy or less fertile soils. Burning high-carbon biomass and applying the resulting biochar to soils is not a novel concept \u2014 \u201cterra preta\u201d (or black earth) has been used to enhance Amazonian soil fertility for centuries.\nRecent research at the UT Institute of\nAgriculture and elsewhere has shown that there are a number of benefits to applying biochar to switchgrass. First, biochar can increase fertility by adding and helping retain nutrients that are already present in the soil because those elements adsorb to biochar particles.\nUnlike some forms of organic matter, biochar is highly stable in soils and therefore, more resistant to decomposition. Thus application of biochar is a way to store carbon from plant residues (sequestration) Figure 1. Biochar produced from switchgrass via pyrolysis at 400 C. in soils.\nUse of Biochar in Switchgrass Production Biochar is low in nitrogen, as heating the feedstock causes the release of some compounds (such as nitrogen); whereas other nutrients (such as P, K, Mg and Ca) become concentrated in the remaining byproduct. Furthermore, most of the usable nutrients in biochar are released slowly, and the material can act as a liming agent in low pH (acid) soils due to its high ash content and alkaline nutrients. Micrograph images reveal that extremely small pores are present in switchgrass biochars, thereby creating a \u201chotel\u201d for beneficial soil microbes (Figure 2).Because of its coarse, friable particles, application and incorporation of biochar can increase soil aeration (Figures 2 and 3) and decrease bulk density (greater porosity) in soils (Figure 3). Reduced bulk density can lead to less compaction and better water infiltration. Therefore, biochar may positively influence soil water-holding capacity due to its adsorbent nature. In general, as biochar application rates increase, soils\u2019 ability to hold and retain water increases. Such Figure 2.

This sample budget was created to guide blueberry producers and those interested in producing blueberries on the factors to consider when estimating their production and marketing costs. Additionally, this sample budget helps users evaluate changes in costs associated with two integrated pest management (IPM) strategies (i.e., low and moderate) and three marketing strategies (i.e., 100 percent ready-picked retail; 50 percent\nU-Pick, 50 percent ready-picked retail; and 75 percent U-Pick, 25 percent ready-picked retail).\nThe sample budget shows examples of blueberry production costs given specific assumptions.\nTherefore, users should modify numbers to estimate their farm costs. Every farm is unique; hence, estimated costs will vary depending on soil conditions, blueberry species, production practices used and pest, weed and disease pressure, among other factors.\nSample Budget Details\nPre-planting\nThe examples presented in this sample budget are based on 1 acre of blueberries. We assumed the blueberry species grown on this acre are Rabbiteye. Although in this sample budget we are assuming only Rabbiteye species are grown, it is important to notice that the combination of two species, such as Highbush and Rabbiteye, would expand the blueberry marketing window. The harvesting period for Highbush species is mid-June to mid-July, and the harvesting period for\nRabbiteye is mid-July to September. The exact time will vary some from year to year and with location.\nWe assumed all preparation activities would happen in Year 0 to allow at least six months to a year for the soil to reach ideal conditions for blueberry production.\nSoil tests are necessary for Year 0, as the results from these tests will guide producers on the requirements to lower pH and adjust soil fertility conditions. Soil tests are budgeted at $15 per soil test. In Year 0, we assumed a soil probe is purchased at $95.91.\nWe assumed raised beds on which to plant blueberries are built in Year 0. By doing this, we can amend the soils to correct issues with pH, organic matter content and internal drainage characteristics. We assumed an initial application of mulch of 269 cubic yards per acre. We also assumed that mulch would need to be reapplied every two years (Years 2, 4 and 6) at 68 cubic yards per acre, assuming a loss of 1.5 inches per year.1 We assumed either pine bark or sawdust is used as mulch and as a source of organic matter that would help adjust soil pH, keep soil temperature cooler during the summer, control for weeds and maintain soil moisture. Ideal organic matter content should be at 3 percent or higher.\nThe ideal soil pH for blueberry production is between 4.5 and 5.5.2 In Year 0, mulch application is one of the strategies to lower soil pH, but we assumed the application of elemental sulfur is needed to rapidly acidify the soil. We assumed 650 lbs at $0.36 per lb of elemental sulfur per acre are applied in Year 0.\nWe assumed 800 lbs per acre of 10-10-10 at $0.22 per lb are applied. We added this fertilizer cost just as a reference as P and K needs will be determined by soil test and vary greatly from farm to farm.\nWe assumed grass would be planted between rows to support equipment used between rows and avoid soil erosion. We also assumed 10 lbs per acre of grass seed at $2.59 per lb is planted in between rows in Year 0.\nPlanting\nWe assumed a 10- or 12-foot space between bed centers and 6-foot space between blueberry plants. This assumption determines the number of plants per acre. If you are growing more than one species, it is probably better to use the same space between rows and plants, regardless of the species, for management purposes. For example, if you have variation in space between rows and plants, that would complicate mowing and other activities that require specific equipment sizes.\nWhen assuming a 6 feet by 12 feet space, 605 two-year-old plants at $4.50 each are transplanted.\nWhen assuming a 6 feet by 10 feet space, 726 2-year-old plants are transplanted. We assumed transplanting happens in early spring (March). The 605-plant density is appropriate for U-Pick operations. Farmers planning to sell wholesale should consider a higher plant density per acre.3 We assumed 15 plants need to be replanted in Year 2. We assumed six hours per acre are designated to remove fruit buds and prune blueberry bushes in Years 1 and 2. It is recommended to not let bushes produce fruit in Years 1 and 2 to allow for better plant establishment, growth and long-term health. Ideally, fruit buds should be removed when plants are dormant, and this is also the best time to prune.\nAnnual pruning of blueberry bushes is required to help with establishing and developing plants that consistently produce large, early maturing berries. After plants are established, pruning is necessary for increased productivity.4 We assumed a pruner would be purchased in Year 1 at $45.\nIn Years 3 and 4, 20 and 30 hours per year, respectively, are designated for pruning activities (24 1 Dellachiesa, A. 2005. \u201cFeasibility of Production and Marketing Blueberries in Tennessee.\u201d M.S.

Available online at https://bit.ly/2SaaTks 2 Sample Budget for Blueberry Production, 2020\nand 36 hours when assuming a plant density of 726 plants/acre). In Years 5 to 7, 50 hours per year are designated for pruning activities (60 hours when assuming a plant density of 726 plants/acre).\nFertilizer, Herbicides, Fungicides and Insecticides\nAs stated above, fertilizer requirements would vary considerably from farm to farm. We assumed soil tests would be performed annually. Although not listed here, tissue tests are recommended to assess plant\u2019s additional nutrient needs. Following the University of Tennessee recommendations, we assumed in Year 1 fertilizer would be applied three times starting about a month after planting the blueberry plants (April) and again in May and June. We assumed only ammonium sulfate would be applied in Years 1 to 7. In Year 1, we assumed 120 lbs of ammonium sulfate are applied at $0.37 per lb (40 lbs in April, 40 lbs in May and 40 lbs in June). In Years 2 to 7, we assumed 60 lbs of ammonium sulfate are applied at similar times as the fertilizer applications in Year 1.\nPersistent weed pests should be eliminated before planting blueberry plants. In the example presented in this sample budget, we did not add costs associated with weed control, as this would vary greatly from farm to farm, depending on specific weed pests. Nonetheless, it is important to acknowledge that effective weed control management strategies are critical when growing blueberries, especially before planting.5\nIn the sample budget, two potential IPM scenarios could be selected: low-input and moderate- input. For the low-input program, we assumed Serenade ASO and Entrust SC are applied at pre-bloom or 10-14 days after petal fall and preharvest. Serenade ASO is a fungicide aimed at controlling a variety of blueberry diseases, including mummy berry, Phomopsis, Botrytis, Alternaria and Exobasidium. Entrust SC is an insecticide, and we assumed it is applied to target insect pests, including thrips, spotted wing drosophila (SWD) and blueberry maggot. The moderate-input treatment included a pre-bloom treatment and a preharvest treatment and included two additional treatments at 10-14 days after petal fall and postharvest. The fungicides listed may be applied during bloom for disease management, but insecticides should not be applied during bloom.\nModerate-input products included Pristine and Switch 62.5WG, both of which are fungicides aimed at controlling the previously mentioned diseases, and Entrust SC and Assail 30SG, which are insecticides that control the previously mentioned insect pests. The moderate-input strategy reflects a higher pest and disease pressure scenario, where additional IPM treatments are required to achieve satisfactory control. It also includes more products, which reflects the need to alternate chemical modes of action, especially when using a more pesticide-intensive IPM program. In Table 1, we show spray schedule assumptions for the two IPM scenarios, and Table 2 shows application rates and price assumptions associated with these two scenarios.\nIt is important to acknowledge that the scenarios presented in Table 2 are just examples of IPM strategies. These strategies would vary depending on the specific pest and disease pressure situations faced by each farm. In either scenario, plantings need to be monitored for SWD. If\nSWD is not found, then no sprays need to be applied for it. If, however, SWD is present, the recommended control program will be the same for the low-input and moderate-input IPM scenarios. This will involve starting with the first spray at two weeks prior to the first anticipated harvest and conducted at weekly intervals throughout the duration of harvest. For Highbush blueberries, where the anticipated duration of the harvest will be about four weeks, this means six sprays for SWD. For Rabbiteye blueberries, where the projected harvest period will stretch to about six weeks or longer, a minimum of eight sprays will be needed. Also, from an insecticide resistance management standpoint, a given insecticide should not be used more than two times before rotating to a second insecticide that has different chemistry. Table 3 lists some alternative insecticides, along with their preharvest interval and notes on their use. According to the University of Tennessee recommendations, a field should be harvested every second to third day to prevent berries from getting overripe, which is critical for SWD control. The University of\nTennessee recommendations also suggest the use of insecticides that have a short preharvest interval. The insecticides presented in Table 3 are labeled for blueberry maggot control as well as 5 Ibid. 3 Sample Budget for Blueberry Production, 2020\nSWD control.

The annual fixed costs associated with this irrigation system is assumed to be $258 per acre. This cost would vary depending on the irrigation system used (e.g., trickle, overhead). Trickle irrigation systems are preferred over overhead systems because the water is applied to the soil or mulch cover and does not contact leaves or fruit, which could aggravate disease issues. In general, trickle irrigation systems use less water and require a lower pump capacity than overhead systems.\nWe assumed one tractor (i.e., a 50 horsepower four-wheel-drive tractor) and a 4x4 utility vehicle are used to perform all activities associated with blueberry production. In Table 4, we show estimated direct (e.g., repair and maintenance, fuel, and labor costs) and fixed costs associated with all implements used for blueberry production in this sample budget. Fixed machinery costs associated with tractors, utility vehicles and implements were calculated using the Mississippi State\nBudget Generator (version 6.0). Blueberry production costs include an annual fixed cost of $440 per acre associated with a cooler used to maintain berry quality and enhance shelf life.\nTable 4.

Gasoline and diesel prices were estimated at $2.20 and $2.30 per gallon, respectively. Hand labor is associated with irrigation check activities, pruning and harvesting. We assigned values to the operator and unpaid family labor at a rate of $17.27/hour.\nCapital\nThe interest on operating capital was calculated annually at a rate of 6 percent. Operating interest is assumed to be charged on half of all variable expenses.\nHarvest and Postharvest\nWe assumed that no crops would be harvested in Years 1 and 2. We assumed plantings would initiate producing yield in Year 3. We also assumed the maximum anticipated yield at crop maturity would happen in Year 6 and would be 12,000 pints per acre or about 20 pints per plant (Table 5). 6 https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor/wages/adverse-effect-wage-rates 5 Sample Budget for Blueberry Production, 2020\nTable 5. Estimated Yields by Year of Blueberry Production Production % of Full Pints/Acre Year Production 0 0.00 0% 1 0.00 0% 2 0.00 0% 3 2000.00 17% 4 6000.00 50% 5 9960.00 83% 6 12000.00 100% 7 12000.00 100%\nWe assumed that harvested berries are sorted into 1-pint plastic clamshells. We assumed a cost of $0.16 per plastic container. We assumed the estimated harvest rate for picking blueberries is 25 pints per hour. Therefore, we assumed 80, 240 and 398 hours are designated for harvesting activities in Years 3, 4 and 5, respectively. After Year 5, 480 hours are designated for harvesting activities. It is assumed that 10 to 15 pickers are needed to harvest 1 acre of blueberries.7\nOperating costs associated with the refrigeration of blueberries to maintain berry quality and enhance shelf life is estimated at $36.60 per acre per year.\nMarketing\nIn this sample budget, we assumed blueberries would be marketed through farmers markets, on-farm, roadside stands and/or Pick-Your-Own (PYO). The choice of marketing strategies would depend on various factors, including farm location that would determine the distance to customers and markets, and labor and time availability for marketing activities. The advantage of marketing blueberries using a PYO strategy is the labor savings associated with reducing harvesting activities. When blueberries are marketed through PYO, it is important to still have some labor available to harvest blueberries in the parts of the field that are not harvested by the customers.\nIt is important for SWD control not to have overripe berries in the field. It is estimated that 450 customers could harvest about 6,000 lbs of blueberries.8\nThere are other considerations and costs associated with using a PYO marketing strategy, including adequate parking area, restroom facilities, convenient and safe access and adequate liability insurance. In the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic, there are additional elements a farm business should consider when running a PYO operation, including logistics to guarantee social distancing between customers, employee training, purchase of Personal Protecting Equipment (PPE) and portable hand-washing stations.9\nMarketing costs were estimated at 10 percent of gross revenue. Gross revenue would depend on marketing strategies. We assumed blueberries would be sold at $2.39 per pint for PYO blueberries and $3.62 per pint for already-picked blueberries sold on-farm, roadside stands or farmers markets. 7 Kaiser, C., and M.

In this Excel tool, users can select different scenarios associated with plant density, IPM and marketing strategies in the \u201cGeneral Assumptions\u201d spreadsheet: 1. You can select the space between rows and bed centers you want to use. This selection will determine the number of plants per acre. You have two options: 6 ft x12 ft and 6 ft x 10 ft. 2. You can select one of two IPM strategies: low and moderate. Each scenario will have different implications for the chemicals you would apply and the frequency of application (see Tables 1 and 2, above). 3. You can select three strategies to market your blueberries: 1) 100 percent retail (e.g., on-farm or at farmers markets); 2) 50 percent PYO and 50 percent ready-picked to be marketed on-farm, at roadside stands or at farmers markets; or 3) 75 percent PYO and 25 percent ready-picked to be marketed on-farm, at roadside stands or at farmers markets.\nAfter making your plant density, IPM and marketing strategy selections, you can evaluate the overall changes in costs and changes in costs per year in the \u201cSummary Budget\u201d spreadsheet. The \u201cPrint\u201d button on this spreadsheet allows the user to print this one-page summary. The \u201cIntro\u201d button allows you to return to the introductory page. On the \u201cSummary Budget\u201d spreadsheet, you can click on the first row of the table \u201cYear X\u201d to see the budget for each year.\nGrowers can modify some values of the individual year\u2019s budget spreadsheets (\u201cBlueberry Budget\nYear X\u201d) highlighted in grey and use the individual year budgets function to evaluate their own production costs per year. If quantities and details of the sample budget are modified, original values can be restored when clicking on the \u201cDefault\u201d button on the bottom right of the \u201cBlueberry\nBudget Year X\u201d spreadsheets. The \u201cPrint\u201d button on these spreadsheets allows the user to print each year\u2019s budget. The \u201cSummary Budget\u201d spreadsheet will not reflect user changes because the summary budget cost categories do not match each year\u2019s budget cost categories.\nUsers should note that input prices used in this sample budget were current as of October of 2020 and are subject to change. Input prices were collected from a handful of randomly selected businesses; therefore, users are encouraged to conduct a thorough search when sourcing input suppliers.\nExamples of Costs Associated With Various Marketing and IPM Strategies\nUsing the Excel sample blueberry budget, we estimated costs associated with two IPM strategy scenarios (i.e., low and moderate) and one marketing strategy (i.e., 100 percent ready-picked blueberries to be marketed through farmers markets, roadside stands or on-farm). As you can see in Tables 6 and 7, in Years 1 to 3, the largest expenses are those associated with incorporating mulch and plants. In Years 3 to 7, the largest expenses are those associated with harvesting and postharvesting activities (i.e., postharvesting costs include marketing costs). The difference in costs associated with the low and moderate IPM scenarios is about $2,000 per acre. Depending on the IPM scenario, costs associated with the fungicides and insecticides represent anywhere between 2 percent and 5 percent of total costs.\nWe also evaluated two different marketing strategies using the Excel sample blueberry budget: 1) 100 percent retail (e.g., on-farm or at farmers markets); and 2) 50 percent PYO and 50 percent ready-picked to be marketed on-farm, at roadside stands or at farmers markets. We assume a moderate IPM strategy in both marketing scenarios. As you can see in Tables 7 and 8, when switching from the 100 percent retail scenario to the 50 percent PYO and 50 percent retail scenario, harvesting costs go from representing about 28 percent of total costs to representing about 18 percent of total costs. Regardless of IPM and marketing strategy used, mulch application, harvesting and postharvesting costs are the largest expenses associated with blueberry production. 7 Sample Budget for Blueberry Production, 2020\nTable 6.

One of the risks is in selling what you grow, and as the old adage goes, \u201cDon\u2019t plant a seed until you have a market.\u201d Contracting with a buyer before the crop is produced is one way to potentially reduce some of the risk, as your market will already be in place. Vegetable production contracts are common; yet more and more involve unique aspects of specialty crop production such as organic production and season extension techniques, as well as food safety considerations. A contract is a business transaction and a legally binding document.\nConsider having a lawyer familiar with agricultural production review the contract. Before entering into any contract, it is important to read the contract carefully and make sure you understand all of the terms within it. If you do not understand something, continue to ask questions until you understand all terms and expectations. Below are questions to ask before entering into any vegetable production agreement, with special attention to alternative production techniques.\nGeneral Questions 1. If you are required to make an investment to enter into the agreement, ask for detailed written information on what the buyer will provide to you in exchange for your investment. For example: How long will the agreement last (one year, multiple years)? Will the contract last long enough to allow you to recover any investments? 2. Is there a specific production protocol to be followed or does the contract bind you to undefined \u201cbest management practices\u201d? 3. Who is liable if the vegetable seed/transplants I buy or receive turn out to be defective? 4. Who determines which (organic or conventional) chemicals you can use on the crop and when you can use them? 5. What happens if weather delays or prevents the harvest? Who bears the risk of loss? 6. Does the contract allow the buyer to inspect the farm? 7. Does the buyer have any food safety requirements?\nVegetable Contracts: Questions to Ask 8. Does a \u201cpassed-acres\u201d clause allow the buyer to decide not to harvest some of the crop, or are they obligated to take all you produce? 9. Are there packaging requirements? If so, will the buyer supply the packaging? 10. Will the crop be stored? If so, where and how? Can you visit/inspect their handling/packaging/shipping facilities? 11. Who is responsible for sorting and grading the produce? To which quality standards will the produce be held (U.S. Department of Agriculture or direct market standards or other)? Who determines the quality of the crop received, and can you appeal any determinations that reduce its value under the contract? After pick-up/delivery (and inspection), how soon must the buyer accept or reject deliveries? 12. If the company refuses to take my crop or releases it, what can I do with it? Are there alternative local markets? 13. How much will you be paid? Are you guaranteed a minimum price per unit? If a potential income range is suggested, ask for a detailed description of how was this range of income derived? When will you be paid? Who will be paying you? 14. If a legal dispute develops, what state will have jurisdiction? 15. When possible, ask other farmers in your area who have worked with the contracting company if they have been happy with services received. Also, will the buyer provide you with a list of growers they have worked with during the past growing season that you can make site visits to and discuss interactions with the buyer? Is the contracting company responsive to the farmer\u2019s questions, providing quick and clear answers? Many of the questions in this section were taken from \u201cA Farmers Legal Guide to Production Contracts\u201d with permission from Neil Hamilton. Certified Organic Production Organic certification provides customers assurance that a product has been grown using organic production methods. For the grower, organic certification can provide access to price premiums and specialty markets. However, organic certification will be an added farm expense and the cost of certification will vary depending on the certifying agency\u2019s fee schedule, farm size, gross farm sales and distance traveled by the inspector. Producers must recertify each year and pay annual inspection fees to maintain the certification. To be eligible for certification, prohibited substances, such as synthetic fertilizers and pesticides, must not have been applied to the land for a period of three years immediately before crop harvest. During the three-year transition period, yields may be lower than those of conventionally produced crops, however, the price premiums obtained may offset the reduced yield. Additionally, organic production can be more labor and management intensive than conventional cropping systems, and growers must follow the USDA\nAugust 2013 2\nVegetable Contracts: Questions to Ask National Organic Program Standards, which provide specific crop production requirements beyond the scope of this publication, but more information can be found at http://organics.tennessee.edu. Here are additional questions to ask if you are considering an organic vegetable production contract: 1. How does the contract address organic certification and enforcement? Does the buyer require a particular organic certifying agency? 2. Does the contract provide support for an organic transition? 3. How does the contract address pesticide residues and other prohibited substances? 4. Does the contract have specific isolation, buffer, or other anti-contamination requirements? 5. Does the contract address \u201csplit operations\u201d or the presence of nonorganic crops or animals? 6. Does the contract require you to go beyond the National Organic Program standards? 7. Does the buyer require a set rotation plan to comply with the organic standards? 8. Does the contract give the buyer access to your organic records (or to your certifier\u2019s records)? 9. What happens if the buyer damages or contaminates the organic products during delivery, subsequent handling, and/or processing? These questions were used with permission from Amanda Heyman from \u201cFarmers\u2019 Guide to Organic Contracts.\u201d Greenhouse or High Tunnel Production Greenhouses and high tunnels offer the opportunity for season extension, increased yield and increased quality of vegetable crops. Both greenhouses and high tunnels require additional expenses and management over field production. However, these two structures are very different from both a production and taxation standpoint. Production specifics for each of these systems are beyond the scope of this publication, but more information can be found at http://vegetables.tennessee.edu under \u201cHelpful Links.\u201d Here are a few basic questions to ask about these structures: 1. Is your property zoned for an agricultural structure? 2. Is the structure exempt from property taxation? 3. If the buyer will build the structure on your farm, who will choose the site/orientation for the structure (you or the buyer)? How will the site be prepared before construction?\nAugust 2013 3\nVegetable Contracts: Questions to Ask Write it down! From the start of the partnership, be sure to get everything in writing. If the terms of the contract change, do not accept verbal changes. Make sure all changes to the contract are written. Keep good records of your production practices as well as records of all communication with the buyer, as you may need to refer back to them later should a problem arise.
